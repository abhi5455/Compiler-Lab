# Compiler Lab Experiments – S7 CSE

This repository contains all the compiler lab experiments conducted as part of the S7 Computer Science curriculum. The experiments cover topics in lexical analysis, syntax analysis, parsing, intermediate code generation, and compiler backend implementation.

## Experiments

1. **Line, Word, and Character Count**  
   Write a Lex program to display the number of lines, words, and characters in an input text.

2. **Substring Conversion**  
   Write a Lex program to convert the substring `abc` to `ABC` in a given input string.

3. **Vowels and Consonants Count**  
   Write a Lex program to find the total number of vowels and consonants in a given input string.

4. **Lexical Analyzer Implementation**  
   Implement a lexical analyzer for a given program using the Lex tool.

5. **Arithmetic Expression Recognition**  
   Generate a YACC specification to recognize a valid arithmetic expression using operators `+`, `–`, `*`, `/` and parentheses.

6. **Identifier Recognition**  
   Generate a YACC specification to recognize a valid identifier which starts with a letter followed by any number of letters or digits.

7. **Calculator Implementation**  
   Implement a calculator using Lex and YACC.

8. **Abstract Syntax Tree Generation**  
   Convert given BNF rules into YACC form and write code to generate an abstract syntax tree.

9. **Lexical Analyzer in C**  
   Design and implement a lexical analyzer in C to recognize all valid tokens in an input program. The analyzer should ignore redundant spaces, tabs, newlines, and comments.

10. **First and Follow Computation**  
    Write a program to find the First and Follow sets of any given grammar.

11. **Recursive Descent Parser**  
    Design and implement a recursive descent parser for a given grammar.

12. **Shift-Reduce Parser Construction**  
    Construct a shift-reduce parser for a given language.

13. **Constant Propagation**  
    Write a program to perform constant propagation.

14. **Intermediate Code Generation**  
    Implement intermediate code generation for simple expressions.

15. **Compiler Backend Implementation**  
    Implement the backend of a compiler that takes three-address code and produces 8086 assembly language instructions. Target instructions include basic operations like move, add, sub, and jump.

16. **ε–Closure Computation**  
    Write a program to find the ε–closure of all states of a given NFA with ε transitions.

17. **NFA Conversion**  
    Write a program to convert an NFA with ε transitions to an NFA without ε transitions.
